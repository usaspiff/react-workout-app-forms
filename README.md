### React Workout App Forms

This React app lets the user select their workout routines with lists of exercises, and create/edit/delete their personnal routines.<br>

### Credits

Those two fantastics tutorials helped me get on track with this projects:<br>
[Getting Started with React – An Overview and Walkthrough](https://www.taniarascia.com/getting-started-with-react/) by Tania Rascia.<br>
[Building forms using React — everything you need to know](https://www.codementor.io/blizzerand/building-forms-using-react-everything-you-need-to-know-iz3eyoq4y) by Manjunath on Codementor Community.

### Things Learned

The goal was to develop a personnal project to master React by creating an app that encompasses all the main concepts listed in the official React docs page such as:
* Rendering elements
* Components and props
* State and lifecycle
* Handling events
* Conditional rendering
* Lists and keys
* Forms
* Lifting state up
* Composition vs inheritance

### What's Next?

List of improvements to make and features to add in the future:
* Authentication with Firebase to store routines
* Improve styling - clean up CSS
* Ability to create individual exercises to form
* Select number of reps per exercise
* Group exercises by categories in form
* Improve playback experience

### Dev section

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).<br>
Run `npm start` to run the app in the development mode.
